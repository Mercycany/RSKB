Founded towards the end of 1066 as part of the Norman Conquest of England, it was built by William the Conqueror. The White Tower, which gives the entire castle its name, was built by 1078, and was a resented symbol of oppression inflicted upon London by the new ruling elite. Throughout its history, the Tower has served variously as a royal residence, armory, treasury, menagerie, the home of the Royal Mint, a public record office, and the home of the Crown Jewels of England. The Tower was besieged several times, and controlling it has been important to controlling the country. The peak period of the castle's use was from the 11th century until the late 16th century. It is a World Heritage Site and one of the nation's leading historic tourist attractions.",

The bridge deck is freely accessible to both vehicles and pedestrians, while the bridge's twin towers, high-level walkways, and Victorian engine rooms form part of the Tower Bridge Exhibition. The bridge is 800 feet (240 m) in length, with two towers each 213 feet (65 m) high, built on piers. The central span of 200 feet (61 m) between the towers is split into two equal bascules or leaves, which can be raised to allow river traffic to pass.

From the 15th century, the castle's importance as a royal residence declined, and by the time of the Wars of the Three Kingdoms, it was principally used as military barracks with a large garrison. Its importance as a part of Scotland's national heritage was increasingly recognised from the early 19th century onwards, and various restoration programmes have been carried out since. As one of the most important strongholds in the Kingdom of Scotland, Edinburgh Castle was involved in many historical conflicts, including the Wars of Scottish Independence and the Jacobite rising of 1745.
